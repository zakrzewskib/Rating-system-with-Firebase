### About

* This project was made after learning basics of Firebase Firestore in 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d-gIPGzmK4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itfjle0ji1xOZ2cjRGY_WB">The Net Ninja tutorial</a>
* Another purpose of this project was to practice HTML5 and CSS3:
  * Flexbox and Grid
  * Positioning (position: absolute for child element and position: relative for parent element)
  * Hover effects, transforming and transition (learned in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjlC18jZe1o">Pasja Informatyki's 
  course</a>)
* And Javascript - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBaw_6cPmAw">Building a Popup</a>

Website is <em>not yet</em> responsive.

There are multitple photos and average ratings, comments etc., 
so I think I should use some <strong>framework</strong> (Vue or React) to create a component and use it mutitple times - it would limit the code and make
it more clean.

### Results
* <strike>(work in progress - link to photos must be replaced in codepen project) You check this project on my <a href="">Codepen</a></strike>.
